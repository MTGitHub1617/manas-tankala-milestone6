There are two main reasons why people choose organic ingredients: potential health benefits and environmental impact.

*   **Potential health benefits:** Organic farming practices emphasize avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. This can mean lower levels of pesticide residue on the food you eat. Some studies suggest that organic fruits and vegetables may also have higher levels of certain antioxidants and other nutrients \[Mayo Clinic, health.clevelandclinic.org].

*   **Environmental impact:** Organic farming is better for the environment in a number of ways. It reduces pollution from synthetic chemicals, helps to conserve water, and promotes soil health. Organic farms also tend to be more biodiverse, which benefits wildlife.
